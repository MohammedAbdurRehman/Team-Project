# Team Project

## Overview

This project is a collaborative effort developed using Git for version control and Python for implementation. The primary goal of the project is to demonstrate teamwork, software development practices, and efficient version control with Git.

## Git Workflow

This project uses Git for managing code and collaboration. Here’s a breakdown of the key Git operations performed in this project:

### 1. **Cloning the Repository**

To start contributing, the first step is to clone the repository to your local machine. This is done with the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MohammedAbdurRehman/Team-Project.git
```

This command creates a local copy of the project repository on your machine, allowing you to make changes.

### 2. **Creating a New Branch**

Once the repository is cloned, create a new branch for the changes you wish to make. This keeps your work isolated from the main branch (often `main` or `master`). To create a new branch, use:

```bash
git checkout -b new-branch-name
```

Replace `new-branch-name` with a descriptive name for the branch you're creating. For example:

```bash
git checkout -b feature-login-page
```

### 3. **Making Changes and Committing**

After creating the branch, you can start making changes to the project. Once you’ve made changes, stage them for commit:

```bash
git add .
```

This command stages all modified files. You can also specify individual files if you prefer to add them separately.

Next, commit the changes with a message describing what was done:

```bash
git commit -m "Added login page feature"
```

### 4. **Pulling Latest Changes**

Before pushing your changes, make sure your branch is up to date with the latest changes from the main repository. Pull the latest changes from the remote repository:

```bash
git pull origin main
```

This command fetches the latest updates from the main branch and merges them into your local branch.

### 5. **Pushing Changes**

Once you've committed your changes and ensured that your branch is up to date with the latest code, you can push your branch to the remote repository:

```bash
git push origin new-branch-name
```

This pushes your local branch to GitHub, where it can be reviewed and merged into the main branch.

### 6. **Creating a Pull Request**

After pushing your branch to the repository, open GitHub, navigate to your repository, and create a Pull Request (PR) to propose your changes. This allows your team members to review the changes before merging them into the main branch.

### 7. **Merging the Pull Request**

Once the changes are reviewed and approved, the pull request can be merged into the main branch. This can either be done by the repository maintainer or by the contributor if they have the appropriate permissions.

To merge changes locally, you can switch to the `main` branch and use the following:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge new-branch-name
```

This will merge the changes from your feature branch into the `main` branch.

### 8. **Deleting the Branch**

After your pull request has been merged, you can safely delete the feature branch both locally and remotely:

```bash
git branch -d new-branch-name
git push origin --delete new-branch-name
```

This keeps the repository clean and free from unused branches.

## Installation
